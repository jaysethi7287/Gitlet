# Gitlet

## Overview
Gitlet is a **Version Control System** that mimics the structure and functionality of **Git** at a simpler level. 

Some of the main features of Gitlet include:

- **Saving** the contents of files/entire directories.
- Maintaining an ordered sequence of **commits**.
- Viewing the **history** of your backups.
- **Restoring** a version of one or more files, or the contents of a previous commit.
- Creating independent **branches** of commits, allowing **merges** to be made between two branches and any changes in their corresponding files.

I utilized complex data structures, serialization techniques, graph traversals, and file persistence to implement Gitlet from scratch. 
## Implementation
Commands implemented include:
- `init`
- `add`, `rm`
- `commit`, `find`
- `log`, `global-log`, `status`
- `checkout`, `reset`
- `branch`, `rm-branch`, `merge`

This project was part of my coursework in UC Berkeley's CS61B Data Structures course. More details regarding the documentation of this project can be found [here](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/sp22/materials/proj/proj3/proj3.html#the-commands). Since this is a class project, I cannot post the code publicly, but can make it available upon request.
